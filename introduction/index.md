# Introduction

I started this resource with a clear intent of making the law approachable and accessible to the everyday South African. It is often the case that the law is thought of this blackbox that is only necessary when you end up in some kind of trouble or to resolve disputes with another party but it is far more than that and if you know just some of the basic legislation you have acquired a power that nobody can ever take away from you which is your **rights**.

## What is the law?

The law is a framework of rules created through a number of legal-political processes. At its core, the law is about justice and fairness. It is designed to protect the rights of individuals and to ensure that everyone is treated equally. The law also plays an important role in maintaining order and preventing harm.
