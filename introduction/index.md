# Introduction

I started this resource with a clear intent of making the law approachable and accessible to the everyday South African. It is often the case that the law is thought of this blackbox that is only necessary when you end up in some kind of trouble or to resolve disputes with another party but it is far more than that and if you know just some of the basic legislation you have acquired a power that nobody can ever take away from you which is your **rights**.

You can expect to find answers to the most gut-wrenching of tasks in this resource such as:

1. *How do I make a statement under oath?*
2. *How do I lodge a complaint to the Department of Labour when my employer does not want to pay me my salary?*
3. *My partner is harassing me, how do I get protection against them?*
4. *What should I do when a police offer stops me, what are my rights?*
5. *I want to report fraud and corruption at my company, how do I do that anonymously?*
