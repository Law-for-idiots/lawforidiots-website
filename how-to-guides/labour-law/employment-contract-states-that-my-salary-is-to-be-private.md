# Employment contract states that my salary is to be private

## What is the issue?

It is common practice for employers to add clauses to their employment contracts which forces the employee to keep their salary private and confidential, meaning that they cannot disclose their salary to any third-party during the course of their employment. It might also be the case that if the employee is caught disclosing their salary to a third-party, they may be issued a disciplinary hearing with a possibility of dismissal. 

This practice by employers has always been unlawful and unenforceable, an employer cannot force you to keep your salary information private, you are allowed to ask other employees about your salary, this allows you to gauge whether the employer is paying you fairly.

::: warning
An employer that is not open about their pay practices definitely has something to hide and you should take this as a red flag immediately.

## What legislation governs this?

The [Basic Conditions of Employment Act of 1997 - Section 78](https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/act/1997/75/eng@1997-12-05#chp_Ten__part_C__sec_78) states that you are within your rights to discuss your conditions of employment with other employees.

## How can the issue be addressed?

Any clauses that are unlawful and unenforceable that are found in your contract, those automatically become invalid but this does not mean that your entire employment contract is invalid. The clauses that are lawful and enforceable still apply, you are welcome to raise it as a concern with your employer or you can reach out to the [Department of Labour](https://www.labour.gov.za/Pages/Default.aspx)
