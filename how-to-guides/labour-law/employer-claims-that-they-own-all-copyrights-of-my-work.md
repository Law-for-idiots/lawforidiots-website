# Employer claims that they own all copyrights of my work

## What is the issue?

It is true, your employer does implicitly own all the copyrights of your work under the [Copyright Act of 1978 - Section 21(d)](https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/act/1978/98/eng@1987-09-25#chp_1__sec_21) so this means that anything that you produce during the scope and course of your employment is in the ownership of the employer.

## What legislation governs this?

The [Copyright Act of 1978](https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/act/1978/98/eng@1987-09-25) covers everything to do with copyrights in regard to the relationship between the employee and employer.

::: tip
If you want to know more about the [Copyright Act of 1978](https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/act/1978/98/eng@1987-09-25), you are more than welcome to set up an online meeting with the [Companies And Intellectual Property Commission](https://www.cipc.co.za/) (CIPC). Just reach out to them via email and they will be more than happy to assist you with any questions that you may have. :smile:

## How can the issue be addressed?

The [Copyright Act of 1978](https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/act/1978/98/eng@1987-09-25) is just a framework in regard to the ownership of copyrights, it does not necessarily mean that it is concrete or absolute, it is malleable. You can negotiate with your employer at the employment contract phase in regard to the _"Intellectual Property"_ clauses. You can make arrangements that all work produced after hours and that does not use company resources can be in your ownership, this is just one case. It is just a matter of coming to an agreement with your employer, you do not have to agree to the standard clauses in the contract.

::: info Summary
Your employer does **own** the copyrights to **all your work produced** during the **course and scope** of your **employment** but it **does not mean** that you cannot negotiate at the employment contract phase or during the scope and course of your employment.
