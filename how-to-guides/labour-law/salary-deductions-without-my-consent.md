# Salary deductions without my consent

## What is the issue?

It is common practice for businesses to deduct money from their employees salary in response to some kind of misconduct such as insubordination. They typically do this by playing on the ignorance of their employees who do not know much about labour law. If an employer wishes to deduct money from your salary they would need to discuss this with you in a formal manner or at least notify you of the intent of doing so and they would need your written consent before they can action this.

## What legislation governs this?

The [Basic Conditions of Employment Act of 1997 - Section 34](https://lawlibrary.org.za/akn/za/act/1997/75/eng@1997-12-05#chp_Four__sec_34), this covers everything in regard to salary deductions.

## How can the issue be addressed?

If your employer has indeed deducted money from your salary without your consent, you are within your rights to at least attempt to address the issue by yourself by:

1. Sending your employer a **letter of demand** or you could get a lawyer to do so on your behalf.
2. You can contact the [Department of Labour](https://www.labour.gov.za/Pages/Default.aspx) (DoL) where you can lodge a complaint against your employer, the DoL may fine the employer for misconduct and they will force the employer to pay you back.
