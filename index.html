    <summary>Founder Story</summary>
    <p>Our founder, Shailen Naidoo created this organization due to lacking the necessary legal knowledge to make a protected disclosure in regard to all the labour law violations, fraud and corruption that is been going on at his previous employer, <a href="https://lumkani.com" target="_blank">Lumkani</a>. It took him 10 months of hard self-study to build a decent enough knowledge base of labour law to make the law work for him. He wants to ensure that others do not suffer like he did by providing you with all the valuable resources that you my need to make the law work for you as well. He is currently unemployed and would appreciate it if you can buy him a coffee, sandwich or some new clothes, donations accepted at <a href="https://paypal.me/shailennaidoo?country.x=ZA&locale.x=en_US" target="_blank">PayPal</a> or send him some food vouchers to his email address <a href="mailto:naidooshailen648@gmail.com" target="_blank">naidooshailen648@gmail.com</a></p>

It was enacted in 1995 and is enforced by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA).
          </p>
          <p>The LRA seeks to balance the rights of employees and employers, and to promote industrial harmony. It does this by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Giving employees the right to form and join trade unions, and to bargain collectively with their employers</li>
            <li>Regulating the right to strike and lockout</li>
            <li>Establishing a framework for resolving labour disputes through conciliation, mediation, and arbitration</li>
            <li>Promoting employee participation in decision-making in the workplace</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The LRA also sets out a number of fundamental principles that must be followed in all labour relations, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The right to fair labour practices.</li>
            <li>The right to freedom of association</li>

          <p>Here are some of the key provisions of the LRA</p>
          <ul>

            <li>Collective bargaining: The LRA establishes a framework for collective bargaining between employers and trade unions. This includes the right to negotiate wages, working conditions, and other terms and conditions of employment</li>
            <li>Strikes and lockouts: The LRA regulates the right to strike and lockout. Strikes and lockouts are only allowed in certain circumstances, and they must be conducted in a fair and orderly manner</li>
            <li>Dispute resolution: The LRA establishes a number of mechanisms for resolving labour disputes, including conciliation, mediation, and arbitration</li>
            <li>Employee participation: The LRA promotes employee participation in decision-making in the workplace. This can be done through workplace forums, joint consultation committees, or other mechanisms</li>

            Employment Equity Act of 1998

          <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.za/sites/default/files/gcis_document/201409/a55-98ocr.pdf" target="_blank">Employment Equity Act of 1998</a> is a South African law that promotes equity in the workplace by eliminating unfair discrimination and implementing affirmative action measures. The EEA applies to all employers, regardless of size, in the private and public sectors</p>
          <p>The EEA prohibits unfair discrimination in all employment practices, including recruitment, selection, training, promotion, remuneration, and termination of employment. It also prohibits discrimination in the provision of benefits, facilities, and services.</p>
          <p>The EEA defines unfair discrimination as any act or omission that directly or indirectly disadvantages an employee or applicant for employment on one or more of the following grounds:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Race</li>
            <li>Gender</li>
            <li>Sex</li>
            <li>Pregnancy</li>
            <li>Marital status</li>
            <li>Family responsibility</li>
            <li>Ethnic or social origin</li>
            <li>Colour</li>
            <li>Sexual orientation</li>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Disability</li>
            <li>Religion</li>
            <li>HIV status</li>
            <li>Conscience, belief, political opinion, culture, language, and birth</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The EEA does not prohibit all discrimination. It is not unfair discrimination to promote affirmative action measures that are consistent with the Act. Affirmative action measures are designed to redress the disadvantages in employment experienced by designated groups, which are black people, women, and people with disabilities</p>
          <p>Employers are required to take steps to eliminate unfair discrimination in their workplaces. These steps include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developing and implementing an employment equity plan</li>
            <li>Conducting a skills audit</li>
            <li>Setting numerical goals for the representation of designated groups in their workforce</li>
            <li>Taking measures to achieve these goals</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Employers who fail to comply with the EEA may be subject to a number of sanctions, including fines, orders to comply, and compensation for employees who have been discriminated against</p>
          <p>The EEA is an important piece of legislation that seeks to promote equality in the South African workplace. It is a complex law, and employers should seek legal advice to ensure that they are complying with its requirements.</p>
