  <h2>Law for idiots</h2>
  <p>Law for idiots is a non-profit organization that aims to make the law a lot less scary to those who are facing legal troubles but have zero experience and no clue where to start when it comes to dealing with legal matters. We do not waste your time with legal jargon and all that nonsense, the law should be accessible to everyone in South Africa and not just those with fat wallets</p>

            Department of Labour (DoL)
          </summary>
          <p>
            The DoL deals with managing general issues between the employee/employer.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some of the issues that the DoL deals with:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Unlawful withholding of salary</li>
            <li>Unlawful Salary deductions</li>
            <li>Labour site inspections</li>
            <li>Unemployment insurance fund applications</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If you have any issue with your employer, you can raise it with any of the <a href="https://www.labour.gov.za/DocumentCenter/Publications/Occupational%20Health%20and%20Safety/Provincial%20Chief%20Inspectors%20and%20IES%20Specialists%20contacts.pdf" target="_blank">Chief Labour Inspectors</a> at the DoL. The inspector will assess your matter and determine whether it is of the jurisdiction of the DoL or CCMA</p>
          <p>If the DoL is unable to resolve your matter, it is best to refer your matter to the CCMA</p>

            CCMA
          </summary>
          <p>
            The Council for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) deals with issues that the DoL is unable to fulfill.
          </p>
          <p>Here are some of the issues the CCMA deals with:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Unfair dismissal</li>
            <li>Unfair labour practices</li>
            <li>Discrimination</li>
            <li>Wage disputes</li>
            <li>Other labour-related disputes</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Think of the CCMA as a step above the DoL in terms of the level of issues that are dealt with</p>

            Labour Court
          </summary>
          <p>
            The Labour Court is at the same level of the High Court, you typically get here if your matter is not able to be resolved through the DoL or CCMA. In most cases, you come to the Labour Court if you were unhappy with the judgement made at the CCMA or if your matter is of a serious nature.
